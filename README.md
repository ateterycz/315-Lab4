A simple assignment in which there are two fields for input on a simple web page that interacts with a database.
A select input, which takes a text input of a specific food and outputs the associated details from the database.
An insert input, which takes two text inputs, a string for food and for calories. It inputs the data into the database through use of a php script.
The associated tables are located in lab4.sql to initialize the table.
